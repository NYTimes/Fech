RE:	  Amended 12 Day Pre-General Report (10/01/2012 - 10/17/2012)

Dear Mr. Stoetzer:

This letter is in response to your letter dated February 15, 2013 regarding the NRA Political Victory Fund’s Amended 12 Day Pre-General Report (10/01/2012 - 10/17/2012) concerning receipts for Line 11(a) that increased from the original report.

When preparing in-house financial statements for the month of October, reconciliations showed that some contributions were not posted to our system by our lockbox service company.  The contributions in question should have been posted with a date of October 16th and 17th but were not deposited into our account until October 19th,  22nd and 23rd.  These deposits in transit were not discovered until a full analysis of our activity for the month of October was performed.  

Once the error was found, corrective action was taken.  The missing items were posted and an amendment showing the additional contributions were reported on Line 11 (a)(iii) of our 12 Day Pre-General Report.

I can be reached at 703-267-1155 should you have any additional questions.

Sincerely,

Mary Rose Adkins
Treasurer
